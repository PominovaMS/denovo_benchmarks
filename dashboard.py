        *De novo* peptide sequencing identifies peptides from mass spectrometry data
        without a reference proteome database. 
        It is essential for discovering novel peptides and in applications 
        where database construction is complicated (immunopeptidomics, metabolomics).
        However, evaluation and comparison of multiple existing methods is challenging
        due to the lack of standardized metrics and universal test datasets.
       
        This project aims to provide a unified framework for the comprehensive benchmarking 
        of *de novo* peptide sequencing algorithms.
        It performs evaluation on both publicly available and internal datasets, 
        encompassing different species, variations in cleavage enzymes (tryptic and non-tryptic data), 
        and various post-translational modifications (PTMs), 
        as well as specific proteomics subfields such as immunopeptidomics. 
        Each algorithm is run in an isolated environment using Apptainer containers 
        to ensure reproducibility and consistency.

        Current benchmarking results are represented below.

        Results are split by the evaluation dataset. 

        Ground truth labels were obtained by running database search

        with [Percolator](http://percolator.ms/) using features from Prosit-predicted spectra.  
        Unless otherwise specified, PSMs with estimated FDR (Percolator q-value) **<1%**
